**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application for musicians to create multilink pages for their releases. The app features user authentication, page creation, subdomain management, and a new cover art generator tool (RandomCover). The landing page has been completely redesigned with a new font (Gilroy) and a full-screen hero section. The application logo has been updated sitewide. The RandomCover feature has just undergone a major rewrite to add advanced UX features like live preview, snapping guides, undo/redo, and autosave.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was working on a major UX overhaul for the  feature. It completely rewrote the  component to implement live previews, snapping smart guides, undo/redo history, and autosaving to localStorage, as requested by the user. The new file has been written, but its functionality has not yet been tested.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should test the new  page functionality thoroughly:
    1.  Verify that the page loads without errors.
    2.  Test the live preview: change text content, font size, and color, and confirm the canvas updates instantly.
    3.  Test snapping: drag an element and verify that guide lines appear and the element snaps to the center of the canvas and to the edges/center of other elements.
    4.  Test Undo/Redo: perform several actions (add text, move, resize) and then use the Undo/Redo buttons (and ideally Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) to verify the state changes correctly.
    5.  Test Autosave: make changes, refresh the page, and verify if a prompt to restore the previous session appears and works.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):** The new  implementation is untested and may contain bugs.

  - **Issues Detail:**
    - **Issue 1: Potential bugs in the new RandomCover component**
      - **Attempted fixes:** A complete rewrite of the component has just been performed. No fixes have been attempted on the new code yet.
      - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Start the application and navigate to the  page.
        2.  Open the browser's developer console and check for any runtime errors.
        3.  Systematically test each new feature as described in the Which testing method to use? section above (live preview, snapping, undo/redo, autosave).
        4.  Inspect the component's state and props using React DevTools to debug any unexpected behavior.
        5.  Review the code in  for logical errors, especially in the history management, snapping calculations, and  interaction.
      - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the user's latest and most complex request. Fixing any issues will complete the implementation of a professional-grade cover art editor, delivering significant value.
      - **Status:** NOT STARTED
      - **Is recurring issue?** N
      - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
      - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1 (P0):** Test and validate the new  editor functionality.
    - **Where to resume:** Navigate to the  page and begin testing the features implemented in the latest version of .
    - **What will be achieved with this?** Confirmation that the live preview, smart guides, undo/redo, and autosave features work as requested.
    - **Status:** TESTING PENDING
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS,  for 2D canvas graphics,  for icons.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (via ).
- **Architecture:** Full-stack monolith with a React SPA consuming a FastAPI backend. Services are managed by .

**key DB schema**
- **users:** (Implicitly updated) Contains user details, roles, plans, and a nested  document.
  - : 
- **covers:** (New collection) Stores metadata for generated cover art.
  - 

**changes in tech stack**
- **Added Frontend Libraries:** ,  for the cover art editor.

**All files of reference**
- : **(Most important)** The file containing the latest, untested implementation of the cover art editor.
- : The completely redesigned landing page.
- : The page for managing subdomains and now also profile/contact information.
- : The public-facing page for a user's subdomain, which now displays profile info.
- : The main navigation component, updated with the new logo and RandomCover link.
- : The main backend file, updated with endpoints for contact info and cover uploading.
- : Updated to include the Gilroy font family.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The most recent task was a complete rewrite of . This new code is powerful but completely untested. The top priority is to test it thoroughly and fix any ensuing bugs.
- The user communicates in Russian. All responses must be in Russian.
- The project uses MongoDB, not PostgreSQL as the user once mentioned. The agent correctly clarified this and proceeded with MongoDB.
- Subdomain testing requires a workaround. The agent patched  to allow testing via query parameters on the preview URL (e.g., ). This is crucial for testing subdomain-related features.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- : Updated to reflect successful backend tests after adding contact info endpoints.
